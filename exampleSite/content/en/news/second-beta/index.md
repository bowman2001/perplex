Author pages are now available and some layout elements have been improved.

<!--more-->

- The release is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bowman2001/perplex/releases/).

- This extensive (but still incomplete) documentation site is available as the [example project](https://github.com/bowman2001/perplexdoc).

- In the coming weeks, I will improve and modularize some components of the theme to make them reusable: Fonts, plugins, image generation...

- The next beta release will include social icons and the necessary parameters for the project and for author pages to add links to social networks.

- And after that, Iâ€™m going to add a dark mode to the theme.
