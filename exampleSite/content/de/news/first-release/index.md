A new fluid-responsive Hugo theme is available for test runs.
{.p-first}
<!--more-->

The release is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bowman2001/perplex/releases/). The extensive (but incomplete) documentation is available as [example project](https://github.com/bowman2001/perplexdoc).

This site and especially the [documentation section](/doc) are a demonstration and a test of the theme.

Until I announce the release in the Hugo forum, the overview in the documentation for seasoned Hugo users will be ready:

- The usual [one-page Markdown demonstration](/doc/overview/markdown)

- A few remarks about the concept and the goals of this theme.  

- Current and planned features.

The next beta release will include author pages. Iâ€™m planning to implement them as taxonomy pages.
