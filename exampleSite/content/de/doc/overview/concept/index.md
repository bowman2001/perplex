A coherent site structure for different publishing formats, a typographic layout for enhanced Markdown content, and good legibility on all screen sizes are the essential goals of this theme.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

Perplex is an all-purpose theme for technical content. There are templates for three levels of documentation, a news stream, blog postings, author pages, and taxonomy pages. Templates for a distinct start page and articles will follow.

At the moment, the example site included in the theme shows the news section as a start page the same way this documentation does.
{.inline}

{{< mnote >}}The entry `url: /` in the front-matter of the section’s list page does accomplish this.{{< /mnote >}}

## Design & Layout

![Sample of IBM Plex Sans](plex_sample)

The theme ships with the open-source font family [Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) for optimized self-hosting. The design has taken their proportions into account from the beginning to provide a good line length for text and code blocks.

{{< mnote up=11 >}}**The design** does **not** implement IBM’s corporate design system [Carbon](https://carbondesignsystem.com/).{{< /mnote >}}

The layout adapts to all screen sizes in a **fluid-responsive** way. This concept has been around for a while but doesn’t get realized often despite its [advantages](/blog/accessibility-of-fluid-typography).

Many proportions can stay fixed between breakpoints beyond mobile and this means:

- The viewport is always used at full width when the screen space is limited.

- The optimal line length stays fixed on all wider screens beyond mobile.

- adjacent columns stay in sync on all larger view-ports, we can place Markdown elements besides each other instead of letting them just flow from top to bottom like a stream.
{.col2}

All text is placed on a **baseline grid** to introduce a comfortable vertical rhythm and coherence between adjacent text elements. Combined with the fluid-responsive design this allows placing images (and other block elements) in and around the text with high accuracy. There are demos for [stand-alone](/blog/image/standalone) & [embedded](/blog/image/embed) images, or [code blocks](/blog/codelayout).

## Usage concept

The theme is as self-sufficient as reasonably possible. Fonts and libraries are included, some libraries for plugins are retrieved from the secure and GDPR-compliant CDN <https://jsdelivr.com>.

Recent copies of all module dependencies are available in the {$_vendor} folder for an easy start with the theme. No other installations than the extended binary (for WEBP) of a very recent Hugo release and the theme are required. 

The installation of a [GoLang environment](https://go.dev/dl/) to include the theme as a Hugo module from its repository is certainly more convenient than repeated manual downloads if you want to follow the ongoing development.

## Support & development

Should you miss some information in the docs, find a bug in the templates, or have a suggestion, please file an official issue in the repositories (&rightarrow; [Introduction](https://perplex.desider.at/doc/intro/perplex#in-case-of-problems)).

There will be no public support channel in the foreseeable future because improving this theme takes all my spare time. Support and collaborative development will only work bidirectional. I will not answer private questions.

In case the theme benefits from contributions and support, I’d love to turn this effort into a community project and change the license holder accordingly to assure, that contributing is never in vain.
