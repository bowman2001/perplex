Two short partials create a link to open the content file{/}of the current page in Hugo’s server mode.
{.p-first}
<!--more-->

The first one renders the opening anchor tag with the VSCode link, the second one places the closing tag. The tags are generated only if Hugo runs in server mode and if a local file is present.

## {$vscode_start.html}

```go-html-template {.inline}
{{- if hugo.IsServer -}}
    {{- with .File -}}
        {{- $path := print "vscode://file" .Filename  -}}
        <a {{ printf "href=%q" $path | safeHTMLAttr }} rel="nofollow">
    {{- end -}}
{{- end -}}{{- /**/ -}}
```

{{< mnote >}}
**If and only if** Hugo’s server is configured to deliver the preview to a public IP address, there may be a security concern with `.Filename`. The link shows the full path to the content files. But by default, Hugo’s preview server only responds on {$localhost}. It is **not meant** to act as a public server.

## {$vscode_end.html}

```go-html-template
{{ if hugo.IsServer }}
    {{- with .File }}
        </a>
    {{- end }}
{{ end }}{{- /**/ -}}
```

## How to apply these partials

You can copy-paste these small snippets into your project, there is no need for a citation or something. The core functionality stems from [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line#_opening-vs-code-with-urls).

The partials are also available as an Apache-licensed module: [{$hugo-mod-open-in-vscode}](https://github.com/bowman2001/hugo-mod-open-in-vscode). This is the better option if you’re interested in possible updates.

The Perplex theme places them around the publishing date or --- in case there is none --- around the title.
