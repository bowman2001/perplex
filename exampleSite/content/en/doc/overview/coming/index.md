Features, which I consider essential, and the ones which would be nice to have.
{.p-first}
<!--more-->

## Essential

Documentation
: The documentation should be up to date :grinning_face_with_sweat:.
{.dl-loose}

## Nice to have

Start page
: A distinct starting page always depends on the project. But the theme should include a template that can be filled easily with Markdown and images.

Article pages
: For long texts a big title, a hero image, and a more centered layout would be more appropriate.

Media shortcodes
: The difficulty with media is to find self-reliant solutions.
  - Video (mp4)
  - AsciiCast (self-hosted). The current shortcode is only a wrapper for a call to the official server.
  - Audio 
  - Image galleries
  - override Hugoâ€™s shortcodes for Youtube and Vimeo because they are not GDPR-compliant.

Better SEO
: The meta tags are fine, Lighthouse gives the theme a 100. But there is still some room for improvement. The theme includes the module [{$hugo-mod-meta}](https://github.com/bowman2001/hugo-mod-meta) for this task.

Archive pages
: Archive pages are not essential for a documentation site. But depending on the content of the other sections, they might come in handy.

Icons
: Allow to use other icon sets than Material Symbols in the menus.

New elements
: Many ideas ...
